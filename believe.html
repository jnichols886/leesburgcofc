  <div>
    <h4 id="god">GOD</h4>
    <p>
      We believe in one God as He is revealed in the pages of the Old and New Testament. There
      is no one else like Him (Isaiah 45:18) and there is no other God besides Him (Isaiah 45:6).
      Scripture reveals Him in so many ways; Creator, Father, Lord, King, Redeemer, Savior, and Judge.
      He is Almighty; omniscient, omnipresent, and omnipotent (Psalm 139:1-16). He is
      righteous (John 17:23) and faithful (1 Corinthians 10:13; 2 Timothy 1:13; 1 John 1:9),
      full of grace and mercy (Ephesians 2:4; Hebrews 4:16; 1 Peter 1:3). He cannot lie and is
      the source of all truth (Titus 1:2; Hebrews 6:1). He is love (1 John 7-8). His name, Yahweh,
      means “I am, I am” and demonstrates the eternal quality of His being; He always is, always
      has been and always will be “I am.” (Exodus 3:13-14; Matthew 22:32)
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4 id="jesus">JESUS</h4>
    <p>
      We believe Jesus is the Son of God (Mark 1:1). We believe He is God in the flesh
      (John 1:1, 14). We believe He came to earth through the miraculous birth to a virgin
      (Luke 1:26-38). We believe He lived a sinless life (Hebrews 4:15) performing miraculous
      signs too many to list (John 20:30-31) but including healing, exorcism, raising the dead,
      and mighty deeds such as walking on water, turning water into wine and multiplying food
      to feed thousands. We believe He preached the Kingdom of God and the Gospel (good news)
      of salvation (Mark 1:14-15). In all these things He showed us the glory of the Father
      (John 1:14 & 14:7-15). We believe and proclaim through our preaching, sharing in the
      Lord’s Supper, and the transformation of the way we live that Jesus “died for our sins
      according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third
      day according to the Scriptures (1 Corinthians 15:3-4). Jesus did not die for His own sin,
      but for ours (1 Peter 2:24). He shed His blood to wash away our sin
      (Ephesians 1:7; 1 Peter 1:18-19; 1 John 1:7). His death defeated death (Hebrews 2:9-18).
      It was impossible for death to hold onto Him and three days later He rose from the dead
      (Luke 24:5; Acts 2:24-32). Forty days later He returned to Heaven and took His rightful
      place of honor and power at God’s Right Hand far above all power and authority
      (Acts 1:9-11; 2:33-35; Ephesians 1:20-21; Philippians 2:9-11). We believe that one day He
      is coming again to take His people home with Him (John 14:1-6; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18),
      but of that day and hour no one on earth knows
      (Matthew 24:35-51; 2 Peter 3:3-13; 1 Thessalonians 5:1-11). Therefore, get ready and be ready!
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4 id="holy_spirit">THE HOLY SPIRIT</h4>
    <p>
      We believe the Holy Spirit is God’s Spirit and, therefore, is Himself God (yes, we
      believe in what is commonly called the Trinity of God). Scripture is filled with the
      various works and ministry He has accomplished. He was there at creation (Genesis 1:2),
      anointed Jesus at His baptism empowering Him to do good (Matthew 3:16; Acts 10:38), raised
      Jesus from the dead (Romans 1:4, 8:11). The apostles were baptized in Him to christen the
      arrival of the last days and the birth of the church (Acts 2:1ff). He is the One who inspires
      the writing of Scripture (2 Peter 1:20-21; 1 Corinthians 2;6-13; 2 Timothy 3:16). We believe
      He is received as a gift at baptism, raising the saved to walk in newness of life, and
      continues to dwell within the child of God (Acts 2:38; Romans 6:4 & 8:9-16; Galatians 5:16-26).
      Christians should live by the Spirit, walk by the Spirit, be led by the Spirit, putting to
      death the deeds of the flesh and being filled with the fruit of the Holy Spirit: love, joy,
      peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4 id="bible">THE BIBLE</h4>
    <p>
      We believe the Bible (also called Scripture) is inspired by God (literally, God-breathed;
      2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:20-21). It is not the word of men, but the Word of God (which is
      only like the difference between night and day—1 Thess. 2:13; 2 Peter 1:16-19). “The Word
      of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as
      the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts
      and intentions of the heart.” (Hebrews 4:12) The Word of God is everlasting (Matthew 24:35;
      1 Peter 1:23, 25). The Bible is the bread of our souls (Matthew 4:4). The message of God’s
      Word saves the soul (James 1:21ff; 2 Timothy 4:16). Faith can only be found through hearing
      the Word of God (Romans 10:17).
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4 id="salvation">SALVATION</h4>
    <section>
      <p>We believe all men who have sinned need saving (Matthew 1:21) and this includes all men
        and women (Romans 3:23). We do not believe we are born sinful or that we inherit sin
        from our fathers and forefathers (Ezekiel 18:2ff). This doctrine, common in the religious world, since
        it teaches we are held accountable because of someone else’s sin is an affront to God’s righteous, just,
        and fair character. We believe Adam and Eve brought sin into the world, as the Scriptures teach (Romans
        5:12) and that all men and women (at some point in their lives) will of their own will and volition
        choose to sin (like Adam and Eve).
      </p>
      <p>Sinners need saving because they are dead (Romans 6:23; Ephesians 2:1). Sin is dangerous
        and deadly and separates us from God (Isaiah 59:3; John 8:23-24). We believe Jesus came
        to seek and save the lost (Luke 17:10) and that He gave His life as a ransom because of
        our sin (Mark 10:45). Jesus came and took our place, bore our sin, and died our death
        (2 Corinthians 5:21; Isaiah 53; 1 Peter 2:21-25). This is a gift from God and an act of
        His grace (Romans 3:21-26; 5:6-8; 7:21-8:8; Ephesians 2:4-10; 1 Thessalonians 5:8-9;
        1 Timothy 1:12-17; Titus 2:11-14; 3:3-7 Hebrews 2:9).
      </p>
      <p>
        Salvation is only possible because of what God and Jesus have done and this is what
        the Bible calls grace. This was an act of love (1 John 4:7-14) and an act of His kind
        intention of His Will (Ephesians 1:3-5, 9). We could never merit or earn or deserve all
        that God has done. It is His grace (His good favor) that saves us. But this does not
        mean there is nothing for us to do to receive that grace.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Acts 2:37, the first one who heard this gospel of grace asked, “Brethren, what shall
        we do?” The answer was not, “Nothing, God has done it all.” The Bible says you must hear
        the Word of Christ (Romans 10:17; John 5:24). Of course, this hearing must lead to faith
        (John 3:16; Acts 16:30-31). But it does not stop there, there is more to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember the believing ones up above in Acts 2:37? I told what the Holy Spirit didn’t
        tell them, but what did He tell them, “And Peter said to them, ‘Repent and each of you
        be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you shall
        receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.” (Acts 2:38).
      </p>
      <p>
        Repentance and baptism are also necessary steps everyone must take to be saved. Only the
        name of Jesus saves. Only the blood of Jesus saves. Therefore, Acts 22:16 recounts
        Ananias’ words to Paul, “Now, why do you delay? Arise and be baptized and wash away
        your sins, calling on His name.”
      </p>
      <p>
        We cannot be saved without the death of Jesus and Romans 6:3 teaches that we are
        “baptized into Christ and into His death." In Romans 6:4 it is only when a person is
        raised from the water of baptism that the begin to “walk in newness of life.” Baptism
        is what Jesus meant in John 3:3-5 when he talked to Nicodemus about being born again.
        Following baptism a person must live “faithful until death” (Revelation 2:10;
        2 Timothy 4:7-8).
      </p>
    </section>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4 id="church">THE CHURCH</h4>
    <p>
      The Bible teaches, again in Acts 2:41, 47 that everyone who was baptized and saved was then
      added by God to His church. We are baptized into His body, the church (1 Corinthians 12-13;
      Ephesians 1:22-23; Colossians 1:18-19). We believe each congregation should be led and served
      by elders (also called bishops and pastors) and deacons (1 Timothy 3:1-16; Titus 1:5-14;
      1 Peter 5:1-4; Acts 20:28; Philippians 1:1). The church is the administration of the Gospel
      message and designed to make know the “manifold wisdom of God (Ephesians 3:9-10). Christ
      died for the church (Acts 20:28) and as His body, “the fullness of Him who fills all in all”,
      no one can have Christ without also having His church.
